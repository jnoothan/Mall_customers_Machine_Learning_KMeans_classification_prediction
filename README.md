# Customer Segmentation using KMeans Clustering

This project applies **KMeans Clustering** for customer segmentation based on **annual income** and **spending score**. It is a classic unsupervised machine learning problem where the goal is to identify groups of customers with similar behaviors to help in targeted marketing strategies.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objective

To analyze customer data and segment them into distinct clusters using KMeans clustering based on their **income** and **spending habits**.

---

- **Attributes used**:
  - `Annual Income (k$)`
  - `Spending Score (1â€“100)`

---

## ðŸ“Œ Key Features

- Preprocessing and normalization of data.
- Elbow method to determine optimal number of clusters.
- Implementation of **KMeans Clustering**.
- Visual representation of clusters.
- Labeling of customer segments based on behavior.
